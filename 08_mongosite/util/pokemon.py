# To import, I open a connection to the server. I check if the db 'test'
# exists. Then, I open the db and open the collection. If the db didn't exist,
# I upload BeanBois.json into the collection 'pokemon', which creates the db
# and the collection. Otherwise, I just continue on with my DB stuff.
#
# This assumes that if the db 'test' exists, the collection 'pokemon' and the
# uploaded documents MUST exist
