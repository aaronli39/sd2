<!--D3 demo: hardcoded bars removed, to be generated fr data-->
<!--
    Can yield a horizontal bar chart if properly bound to data
    (steelblue bars, white number overlays)
    ...but will yield only blank page at first.

<!--------------------------------
    Entering the following commands via console will 
    incrementally re-create your hardcoded chart...
   
    1) Init your data:
    var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];
        Predictions: 
            * will initialize an array of said input
            * will return undefined since the declaration doesn't return anything
        Results:
            * not much notable, you can see the array by calling data again

    2) Select your chart.
        var chart = d3.select(".chart");
        Predictions:
            * will select the chart div and put it as a javascript object so 
            functions can be called or performed on it
        Results:
            * i see that chart is an object with different attributes or data
            such as _groups and _parents. Accessing _groups gives you the actual
            chart div as well as some basic information such as length. Once the children
            divs are recreated it also lists the information of the children divs
    
    3) Prepare for data join.
    var bar = chart.selectAll("div");
    (this defines selection to which you will join data)
        Predictions:
            * not sure, since the chart obj is empty right now but you're selecting the divs
            of that empty div with no child divs
        Results:
            * returns an obj with the same _groups and _parents field. There is a nodelist
            in _groups though I'm not sure what that does. Just selects the div I guess so
            you can append data to it in the next step?

    3) Join your data.
    var barUpdate = bar.data(data);
        Predictions:
            * this will actually set the data of the bars to the array that 
            we instantiated in the first step
        Results:
            * sure enough, the data array could be found in barUpdate._enter's array
            * no idea what _exit is, and why this obj also has _groups and _parent. I'm
            assuming it has it to keep track of child nodes and parent nodes
    4) Instantiate new elements by appending to the “enter selection.”
    var barEnter = barUpdate.enter().append("div");
        Predictions:
            * will actually add the divs for the data to live in
        Results:
            * a bar appeared equal to the number of elements in the array
    5) Set width of each bar proportional to its data value.
    barEnter.style("width", function(d) {
    return d * 10 + "px"; });
        Predictions:
            * this will set the style for each "d" in data to have 10x their
            value in pixels
        Results:
            * prediction was correct!
    6) Label each bar.
    barEnter.text(function(d) { return d; });
        Predictions:
            * this is simple... sets the text for each div to be the value
            of the element in the array
